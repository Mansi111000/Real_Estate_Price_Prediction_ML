## 🔍 Introduction

Predicting property prices is essential for real estate buyers, sellers, and investors. This project aims to:

- Analyze key factors influencing property prices.
- Build a robust ML model to predict real estate prices.
- Provide valuable insights into real estate trends.

The model is trained using **machine learning techniques**, with an emphasis on **data cleaning, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning**.

---

## 🛠 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection** - Collect real estate data containing various property attributes.
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical data.
3. **Feature Engineering** - Select the most relevant features for the model.
4. **Model Selection & Training** - Compare different ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost, etc.).
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning** - Optimize the model for better performance.
6. **Evaluation & Predictions** - Assess model accuracy using performance metrics.
7. **Deployment (Optional)** - Deploy the model using Flask/Django API.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Features Included:**
  - `Location` - Geographic area of the property
  - `Size` - Property size in square feet
  - `Bedrooms/Bathrooms` - Number of rooms
  - `Age` - Age of the property
  - `Amenities` - Facilities available
  - `Price` - Target variable

- **Preprocessing Steps:**
  - Handling missing values.
  - Encoding categorical variables.
  - Feature scaling using MinMaxScaler/StandardScaler.
